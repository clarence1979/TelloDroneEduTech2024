# TelloDroneEduTech2024
This repository contains the code to control the Tello Drone using voice and Google Gemini. Run this in in any editor (preferably VS Code) in the Windows or the Raspberry Pi environment with all dependencies installed.

You can add the list of available actions by referring to the API in the online document: https://djitellopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tello/ and copying reelvant commands into the tello_basic.txt file. The purpose of this file is to restrict the number of actions that can be selected by the AI-generated code so that there are no errors.

Speak what you want, and the drone will obey your command.
